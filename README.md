# PyroUI

Uses web components for a flexible and versatile ui component library that's supported in every framework.

## Usage
Simply add the `script.js` and `styles.css` to your project, and link to these files whereever you need to use them. You can get a list of the currently available components from checking `index.html`, as I'm still constantly changing them around.
